                Hello! So this is the color code test! Yes, so prestigious, I
                know, so beautiful! Oh, stop! stop, I'm blushing! So, yes, this
                test was not created by Yours Truly, I've only transcribed it
                to an accessable form. Hey, it's okay, it's okay! You're
                welcome!
                <!-- and for those of you looking at the code—yes, I know
                you're reading this! and if you're not, you won't at all know
                I'm here believing you're reading this—there's not much to see
                here, so you can get back to testing out your personality and
                whatnot. Stop waisting time here! -->
