## Introduction

It's good to be the dungeon master! Not only
do you get to tell fantastic stories about
heroes, villains, monsters, and magic, but
you also get to create the world in which
these stories live. Whether you're running a
D&D game already or you think it's something
you want to try, this book is for you.

The Dungeon Master's Guide assumes that you
know the basics of how to play the D&D
tabletop roleplaying game. If you haven't
played before, the Dungeons & Dragons
Starter Set is a great starting point for new
players and DMs.

This book has two important companions: the
Player's Handbook, which contains the rules
your players need to create characters and
the rules you need to run the game, and the
Monster Manual, which contains ready-to-use
monsters to populate your D&D world.

### The Dungeon Master

The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force
behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for
the other players to explore, and also
creates and runs adventures that drive the
story. An adventure typically hinges on the
successful completion of a quest, and can be
as short as a single game session. Longer
adventures might embroil players in great
conflicts that require multiple game sessions
to resolve. When strung together, these
adventures form an ongoing campaign. A D&D
campaign can include dozens of adventures and
last for months or years.

A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As
the architect of a campaign, the DM creates
adventures by placing monsters, traps, and
treasures for the other players' characters
(the adventurers) to discover. As a
storyteller, the DM helps the other players
visualize what's happening around them,
improvising when the adventurers do something
or go somewhere unexpected. As an actor, the
DM plays the roles of the monsters and
supporting characters, breathing life into
them. And as a referee, the DM interprets the
rules and decides when to abide by them and
when to change them.

Inventing, writing, storytelling,
improvising, acting, refereeing-every DM
handles these roles differently, and you'll
probably enjoy some more than others. It
helps to remember that Dungeons & Dragons is
a hobby, and being the DM should be fun.
Focus .on the aspects you enjoy and downplay
the rest. For example, if you don't like
creating your own adventures, you can use
published ones. You can also lean on the
other players to help you with rules mastery
and world-building.

The D&D rules help you and the other players
have a good time, but the rules aren't in
charge. You're the DM, and you are in charge
of the game. That said, your goal isn't to
slaughter the adventurers but to create a
campaign world that revolves around their
actions and decisions, and to keep your
players coming back for more! If you're
lucky, the events of your campaign will echo
in the memories of your players long after
the final game session is concluded.

### How to Use This Book

This book is organized in three parts. The
first part helps you decide what kind of
campaign you'd like to run. The second part
helps you create the adventures—the
stories—that will compose the campaign and
keep the players entertained from one game
session to the next. The last part helps you
adjudicate the rules of the game and modify
them to suit the style of your campaign.

#### Part 1: Master of Worlds

Every DM is the creator of his or her own
campaign world. Whether you invent a world,
adapt a world from a favorite movie or novel,
or use a published setting for the D&D game,
you make that world your own over the course
of a campaign.

The world where you set your campaign is one
of countless worlds that make up the D&D
multiverse, a vast array of planes and worlds
where adventures happen. Even if you're using
an established world such as the Forgotten
Realms,your campaign takes place in a sort of
mirror universe of the official setting where
Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and
digital games are assumed to take place. The
world is yours to change as you see fit and
yours to modify as you explore the
consequences of the players' actions.

Your world is more than just a backdrop for
adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and
countless other fantasy worlds out there,
it's a place to which you can escape and
witness fantastic stories unfold. A
well-designed and well-run world seems to
flow around the adventurers, so that they
feel part of something, instead of apartfrom
it.

Consistency is a key to a believable
fictional world. When the adventurers go back
into town for supplies, they should encounter
the same nonplayer characters.(NPCs) they met
before. Soon, they'll learn the barkeep's
name, and he or she will remember theirs as
well. Once you have achieved this degree of
consistency,you can provide an occasional
change. If the adventurers come back to buy
more horses at the stables, they might
discover that the man who ran the place went
back home to the large city over the hills,
and now his niece runs the family business.
That sort of · change- one that has nothing
to do with the adventurers directly, but one
that they'll notice- makes the players feel
as though their characters are part of a
living world that changes and grows along
with them.

Part 1 of this book is all about inventing
your world. Chapter 1 asks what type of game
you want to run, and helps you nail down a
few important details about your world and
its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps
you put your world in the greater context of
the multiverse, expanding on the information
presented in the Player's Handbook to discuss
the planes of existence and the gods and how
you can put them together to serve the needs
of your campaign.

#### Part 2: Master of Adventures

Whether you write your own adventures or use
published ones, expect to invest preparation
time beyond the hours you spend at the gaming
table. You'll need to carve out some free
time to exercise your creativity as you
invent compelling plots, create new NPCs,
craft encounters, and think of clever ways to
foreshadow story events yet to come.

Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you
create and run great adventures. Chapter 3
covers the basic elements of a D&D adventure,
and chapter 4 helps you create memorable
NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines and
advice for running adventures set in
dungeons, the wilderness, and other locales,
and chapter 6 covers the time between
adventures. Chapter 7 is all about treasure,
magic items, and special rewards that help
keep the players invested in your campaign.

#### Part 3: Master of Rules

DUNGEONS & DRAGONS isn't a head-to-head
competition, but it needs someone who is
impartial yet involved in the game to
guarantee that everyone at the table plays by
the rules. As the player who creates the game
world and the adventures that take place
within it, the DM is a natural fit to take on
the referee role.

As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator
between the rules and the players. A player
tells the DM what he or she wants to do, and
the DM determines whether it is successful or
not, in some cases asking the player to make
a die roll to determine success. For example,
if a player wants his or her character to
take a swing at an orc, you say, "Make an
attack roll" while looking up the orc's Armor
Class.

The rules don't account for every possible
situation that might arise during a typical
D&D session. For example, a player might want
his or her character to hurl a brazier full
of hot coals into a monster's face. How you
determine the outcome of this action is up to
you. You might tell the player to make a
Strength check, while mentally setting the
Difficulty Class (DC) at 15. If the Strength
check is successful, you then determine how a
face full of hot coals affects the monster.
You might decide that it deals ld4 fire
damage and imposes disadvantage on the
monster's attack rolls until the end of its
next turn. You roll the damage die (or let
the player do it), and the game continues.

Sometimes mediating the rules means setting
limits. If a player tells you, "I want to run
up and attack the ore," but the character
doesn't have enough movement to reach the
ore, you say, "It's too far away to move up
and still attack. What would you like to do
instead?" The player takes the information
and comes up with a different plan.

To referee the rules, you need to know them.
You don't have to memorize this book or the
Player's Handbook, but you should have a
clear idea of their contents so that, when a
situation requires a ruling, you know where
to find the proper reference.

The Player's Handbook contains the main rules
you need to play the game. Part 3 of this
book offers a wealth of information to help
you adjudicate the rules in a wide variety of
situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for
using attack rolls, ability checks, and
saving throws. It also includes options
appropriate for certain play styles and
campaigns, including guidelines for using
miniatures, a system for handling chase
scenes, and rules for madness. If you like to
create your own stuff, such as new monsters,
races, and character backgrounds, chapter 9
shows you how. That chapter also contains
optional rules for unusual situations or play
styles, such as the use of firearms in a
fantasy setting.

### Know Your Players

The success of a D&D game hinges on your
ability to entertain the other players at the
game table. Whereas their role is to create
characters (the protagonists of the
campaign), breathe life into them , and help
steer the campaign through their characters'
actions, your role is to keep the players
(and yourself) interested and immersed in the
world you've created, and to let their
characters do awesome things.

Knowing what your players enjoy most about
the D&D game helps you create and run
adventures that they will enjoy and remember.
Once you know which of the following
activities each player in your group enjoys
the most, you can tailor adventures that
satisfy your players' preferences as much as
possible, thus keeping them
engaged.

#### Acting

Players who enjoy acting like getting into
character and speaking in their characters'
voices. Roleplayers at heart, they enjoy
social interactions with NPCs, monsters, and
their fellow party members.

Engage players who like acting by...
* giving them opportunities to develop their
    characters' personalities and
    backgrounds.
* allowing them to interact regularly with
    NPCs.
* adding roleplaying elements to combat
    encounters.
* incorporating elements from their
    characters' backgrounds into your
    adventures.

#### Exploring

Players who desire exploration want to
experience the wonders that a fantasy world
has to offer. They want to know what's around
the next corner or hill. They also like to
find hidden clues and treasure.

Engage players who like exploration by...
* dropping clues that hint at things yet to
    come.
* letting them find things when they take the
    time to explore.
* providing rich descriptions of exciting
    environments, and using interesting maps
    and props.
* giving monsters secrets to uncover or
    cultural details to learn.

#### Instigating

Players who like to instigate action are
eager to make things happen, even if that
means taking perilqus risks. They would
rather rush headlong into danger and face the
consequences than face boredom.

Engage players who like to instigate by...
* allowing them to affect their surroundings.
* including things in your adventures to
    tempt them.
* letting their actions put the characters in
    a tight spot.
* including encounters with NPCs who are as
    feisty and unpredictable as they are.

#### Fighting

Players who enjoy fantasy combat like kicking
the tar out of villains and monsters. They
look for any excuse to start a fight,
favoring bold action over careful
deliberation.

Engage players who like fighting by...
* springing unexpected combat encounters on
    them.
* vividly describing the havoc their
    characters wreak with their attacks and
    spells.
* including combat encounters with large
    numbers of weak monsters.
* interrupting social interaction and
    exploration with combat.

#### Optimizing

Players who enjoy optimizing their
characters' capabilities like to fine-tune
their characters for peak combat performance
by gaining levels, new features, and magic
items. They welcome any opportunity to
demonstrate their characters' superiority.

Engage players who like optimization by...
* ensuring steady access to new abilities and
    spells.
* using desired magic items as adventure
    hooks.
* including encounters that let their
    characters shine.
* providing quantifiable rewards, like
    experience points, for noncombat
    encounters.

#### Problem Solving

Players who want to solve problems like to
scrutinize NPC motivations, untangle a
villain's machinations, solve puzzles, and
come up with plans.

Engage players who like to solve problems by...
* including encounters that emphasize
    problem-solving.
* rewarding planning and tactics with in-game
    benefits.
* occasionally allowing a smart plan to grant
    an easy win for the players.
* creating NPCs with complex motives.

#### Storytelling

Players who love storytelling want to
contribute to a narrative. They like it when
their characters are heavily invested in an
unfolding story, and they enjoy encounters
that are tied to and expand an overarching
plot.

Engage players who like storytelling by...
* using their characters' backgrounds to help
    shape the stories of the campaign.
* making sure an encounter advances the story
    in some way.
* making their characters' actions help steer
    future events.
* giving NPCs ideals, bonds, and flaws that
    the adven- turers can exploit.

## Part 1

Master of Worlds

## Chapter 1: A World of Your Own

Your world is the setting for your campaign,
the place where adventures happen. Even if
you use an existing setting, such as the
Forgotten Realms, it becomes yours as you set
your adventures there, create characters to
inhabit it, and make changes to it over the
course of your campaign. This chapter is all
about building your world and then creating a
campaign to take place in it.

### The Big Picture


This book, the Player's Handbook, and the
Monster Manual present the default
assumptions for how the worlds of D&D work.
Among the established settings of D&D, the
Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and
Mystara don't stray very far from those
assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun,
Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, and
Planescape venture further away from that
baseline. As you create your own world, it's
up to you to decide where on the spectrum you
want your world to fall.

#### Core Assumptions

The rules of the game are based on the
following core assumptions about the game
world.

**Gods Oversee the World.** The gods are real and
embody a variety of beliefs, with each god
claiming dominion over an aspect of the
world, such as war, forests, or the sea. Gods
exert influence over the world by granting
divine magic to their followers and sending
signs and portents to guide them. The
follower of a god serves as an agent of that
god in the world. The agent seeks to further
the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals.
While some folk might refuse to honor the
gods, none can deny their existence.

**Much of the World Is Untamed.** Wild regions
abound. City-states, confederacies, and
kingdoms of various sizes dot the Ia ndscape,
but beyond their borders the wilds crowd in.
People know the area they live in well.
They've heard stories of other places from
merchants and travelers, but few know what
lies beyond the mountains or in the depths of
the great forest unless they've been there
themselves.

**The World Is Ancient.** Empires rise and fall,
leaving few places that have not been touched
by imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and
natural forces eventually claim the mortal
world, leaving it rich with places of
adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations
and their knowledge survive in legends, magic
items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often
follow an empire's collapse.

**Conflict Shapes the World's History.**
Powerful individuals strive to make their
mark on the world, and factions of
like-minded individuals can alter the course
of history. Factions include religions led by
charismatic prophets, kingdoms ruled by
lasting dynasties, and shadowy societies that
seek to master long-lost magic. The influence
of such factions waxes and wanes as they
compete with each other for power. Some seek
to preserve the world and usher in a golden
age. Others strive toward evil ends, seeking
to rule the world with an iron fist. Still
others seek goals that range from the
practical to the esoteric, such as the
accumulation of material wealth or the
resurrection of a dead god. Whatever their
goals, these factions inevitably collide,
creating conflict that can steer the world's
fate.

**The World Is Magical.** Practitioners of
magic are relatively few in number, but they
leave evidence of their craft everywhere. The
magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as
a potion that heals wounds to something much
more rare and impressive, such as a
levitating tower or a stone golem guarding
the gates of a city. Beyond the realms of
civilization are caches of magic items
guarded by magic traps, as well as magically
constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters
created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed
with magical abilities.

#### It's Your World

In creating your campaign world, it helps to
start with the core assumptions and consider
how your setting might change them. The
subsequent sections of this chapter address
each element and give details on how to flesh
out your world with gods, factions, and so
forth.

The assumptions sketched out above aren't
carved in stone. They inspire exciting D&D
worlds full of adventure, but they're not the
only set of assumptions that can do so. You
can build an interesting campaign concept by
altering one or more of those core
assumptions, just as well-established D&D
worlds have done. Ask yourself, "What if the
standard assumptions weren't true in my
world?"

**The World Is a Mundane Place.** What if
magic is rare and dangerous, and even
adventurers have limited or no access to it?
What if your campaign is set in a version of
our own world's history?

**The World Is New.** What if your world is
new, and the characters are the first of a
long line of heroes? The adventurers might be
champions of the first great empires, such as
the empires of Netheril and Cormanthor in the
Forgotten Realms setting.

**The World Is Known.** What if the world is
completely charted and mapped, right down to
the "Here there be dragons" notations? What
if great empires cover huge stretches of
countryside, with clearly defined borders
between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron
setting were once part of a great empire, and
magically aided travel between its cities is
commonplace.

**Monsters Are Uncommon.** What if monsters
are rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft
setting, horrific domains are governed by
monstrous rulers. The populace lives in
perpetual terror of these darklords and their
evil minions, but other monsters rarely
trouble people's daily lives.

**Magic Is Everywhere.** What if every town
is ruled by a powerful wizard? What if magic
item shops are common? The Eberron setting
makes the use of magic an everyday
occurrence, as magical flying ships and
trains carry travelers from one great city to
another.

**Gods Inhabit the Land, or Are Entirely
Absent.** What if the gods regularly walk the
earth? What if the characters can challenge
them and seize their power? Or what if the
gods are remote, and even angels never make
contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun
setting, the gods are extremely
distant-perhaps nonexistent-and clerics rely
instead on elemental power for their magic.
