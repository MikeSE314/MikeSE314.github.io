<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><i><b>Multiattack.</b></i> The harpy makes two attacks: one with its claws and one with its club.</p>
<p><i><b>Claws.</b></i> <i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 6 (2d4 + 1) slashing damage.</p>
<p><i><b>Club.</b></i> <i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><i><b>Luring Song.</b></i> The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within 300 feet of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the harpy is incapacitated.</p>
<p>While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the harpy, the target must move on its turn toward the harpy by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn't avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the harpy, the target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.</p>
<p>A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song for the next 24 hours.</p>
