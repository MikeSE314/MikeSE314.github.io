<p><i><b>Shapechanger.</b></i> The wereboar can use its action to polymorph into a boar-humanoid hybrid or into a boar, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its AC, are the same in each form.</p>
<p>Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
<p><i><b>Charge (Boar or Hybrid Form Only).</b></i> If the wereboar moves at least 15 feet straight toward a target and then hits it with its tusks on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.</p>
<p><i><b>Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).</b></i> If the wereboar takes 14 damage or less that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><i><b>Multiattack (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).</b></i> The wereboar makes two attacks, only one of which can be with its tusks.</p>
<p><i><b>Maul (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only).</b></i> Melee</p>
<p>Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><i><b>Tusks (Boar or Hybrid Form Only).</b></i> <i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 10 (2d6 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wereboar lycanthropy.</p>
