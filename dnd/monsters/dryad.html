<p><i><b>Innate Spellcasting.</b></i> The dryad's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14). The dryad can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:</p>
<p>At will: <i>druid craft</i></p>
<p>3/day each: <i>entangle</i>, <i>good berry</i></p>
<p>1/day each: <i>barkskin</i>, <i>pass without trace</i>, <i>shillelagh</i></p>
<p><i><b>Magic Resistance.</b></i> The dryad has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.</p>
<p><i><b>Speak with Beasts and Plants.</b></i> The dryad can communicate with beasts and plants as if they shared a language.</p>
<p><i><b>Tree Stride.</b></i> Once on her turn, the dryad can use 10 feet of her movement to step magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a second living tree within 60 feet of the first tree, appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the second tree.</p>
<p>Both trees must be Large or bigger.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><i><b>Club.</b></i> <i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +2 to hit (+6 to hit with shillelagh), reach 5 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage, or 8 (1d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage with shillelagh.</p>
<p><i><b>Fey Charm.</b></i> The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30 feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's control, it takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way it can.</p>
<p>Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey</p>
<p>Charm for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three beasts charmed at a time.</p>
