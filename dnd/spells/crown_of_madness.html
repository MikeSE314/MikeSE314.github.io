<h1>Crown of Madness</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level enchantment</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 120 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>One humanoid of your choice that you can see
within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or become charmed by you for the
duration. While the target is charmed in this
way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears
on its head, and a madness glows in its eyes.</p>

<p>The charmed target must use its action before
moving on each of its turns to make a melee
attack against a creature other than itself
that you mentally choose. The target can act
normally on its turn if you choose no
creature or if none are within its reach.</p>

<p>On your subsequent turns, you must use your
action to maintain control over the target,
or the spell ends. Also, the target can make
a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of
its turns. On a success, the spell ends.</p>
