<h1>Geas</h1>

<p><i>5th-level enchantment</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 30 days</p>

<p>You place a magical command on a creature
that you can see within range, forcing it to
carry out some service or refrain from some
action or course of activity as you decide.
If the creature can understand you, it must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
charmed by you for the duration. While the
creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10
psychic damage each time it acts in a manner
directly counter to your instructions, but no
more than once each day. A creature that
can't understand you is unaffected by the
spell.</p>

<p>You can issue any command you choose, short
of an activity that would result in certain
death. Should you issue a suicidal command,
the spell ends.</p>

<p>You can end the spell early by using an
action to dismiss it. A <a href="./remove_curse.html">remove curse</a>,
<a href="./greater_restoration.html">greater restoration</a>, or <a href="./wish.html">wish</a> spell also
ends it.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level,
the duration is 1 year. When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the
spell lasts until it is ended by one of the
spells mentioned above.</p>
