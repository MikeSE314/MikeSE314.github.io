<h1>Feather Fall</h1>

<p><i>1st-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, M (a small feather or piece of down)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p>Choose up to five falling creatures within
range. A falling creature's rate of descent
slows to 60 feet per round until the spell
ends. If the creature lands before the spell
ends, it takes no falling damage and can land
on its feet, and the spell ends for that
creature.</p>
