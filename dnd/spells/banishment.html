<h1>Banishment</h1>

<p><i>4th-level abjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (an item distasteful
to the target)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You attempt to send one creature that you can
see within range to another plane of
existence. The target must succeed on a
Charisma saving throw or be banished.</p>

<p>If the target is native to the plane of
existence you’re on, you banish the target to
a harmless demiplane. While there, the target
is incapacitated. The target remains there
until the spell ends, at which point the
target reappears in the space it left or in
the nearest unoccupied space if that space is
occupied.</p>

<p>If the target is native to a different plane
of existence than the one you’re on, the
target is banished with a faint popping
noise, returning to its home plane.</p>

<p>If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed,
the target reappears in the space it left or
in the nearest unoccupied space if that space
is occupied. Otherwise, the target doesn't
return.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 5th level or
higher, you can target one additional
creature for each slot level above 4th.</p>
