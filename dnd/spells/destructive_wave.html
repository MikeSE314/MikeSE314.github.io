<p>You strike the ground, creating a burst of
divine energy that ripples outward from you.
Each creature you choose within 30 feet of
you must succeed on a Constitution saving
throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as
5d6 radiant or necrotic damage (your choice),
and be knocked prone. A creature that
succeeds on its saving throw takes half as
much damage and isnâ€™t knocked prone.</p>
