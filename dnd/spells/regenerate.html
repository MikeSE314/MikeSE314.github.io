<h1>Regenerate</h1>

<p><i>7th-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a prayer wheel and
holy water)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour</p>

<p>You touch a creature and stimulate its
natural healing ability. The target regains
4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the
spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the
start of each of its turns (10 hit points
each
minute).</p>

<p>The targetâ€™s severed body members (fingers,
legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored
after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part
and hold it to the stump, the spell
instantaneously causes the limb to knit to
the stump.</p>
