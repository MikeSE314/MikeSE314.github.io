<h1>Arcane Eye</h1>

<p><i>4th-level divination</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>You create an invisible, magical eye within
range that hovers in the air for the
duration.</p>

<p>You mentally receive visual information from
the eye, which has normal vision and
darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look
in every direction.</p>

<p>As an action, you can move the eye up to 30
feet in any direction. There is no limit to
how far away from you the eye can move, but
it can’t enter another plane of existence. A
solid barrier blocks the eye’s movement, but
the eye can pass through an opening as small
as 1 inch in diameter.</p>
