<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (soft clay, which

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You touch a stone object of Medium size or
smaller or a section of stone no more than 5
feet in any dimension and form it into any
shape that suits your purpose. So, for
example, you could shape a large rock into a
weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small
passage through a wall, as long as the wall
is less than 5 feet thick. You could also
shape a stone door or its frame to seal the
door shut. The object you create can have up
to two hinges and a latch, but finer
mechanical detail isnâ€™t possible.</p>
