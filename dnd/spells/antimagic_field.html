<h1>Antimagic Field</h1>

<p><i>8th-level abjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self (10-foot-radius sphere)</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a pinch of powdered
iron or iron filings)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of
antimagic surrounds you. This area is
divorced from the magical energy that
suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere,
spells can’t be cast, summoned creatures
disappear, and even magic items become
mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere
moves with you, centered on you.</p>

<p>Spells and other magical effects, except
those created by an artifact or a deity, are
suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude
into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed
spell is consumed. While an effect is
suppressed, it doesn't function, but the time
it spends suppressed counts against its
duration.</p>

<p><i><b>Targeted Effects.</b></i> Spells and other
magical effects, such as <a href="./magic_missile.html">magic missile</a> and
<a href="./charm_person.html">charm person</a>, that target a creature or an
object in the sphere have no effect on that
target.</p>

<p><i><b>Areas of Magic.</b></i> The area of another
spell or magical effect, such as <a href="./fireball.html">fireball</a>,
can’t extend into the sphere.</p>

<p>If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the
part of the area that is covered by the
sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames
created by a <a href="./wall of fire.html">wall of fire</a> are suppressed
within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall
if the overlap is large enough.</p>

<p><i><b>Spells.</b></i> Any active spell or other
magical effect on a creature or an object in
the sphere is suppressed while the creature
or object is in it.</p>

<p><i><b>Magic Items.</b></i> The properties and powers
of magic items are suppressed in the sphere.
For example, a <i>+1 longsword</i> in the sphere
functions as a nonmagical longsword.</p>

<p>A magic weapon’s properties and powers are
suppressed if it is used against a target in
the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the
sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic
ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for
example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a
magic spear at a target outside the sphere),
the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed
as soon as it exits.</p>

<p><i><b>Magical Travel.</b></i> Teleportation and
planar travel fail to work in the sphere,
whether the sphere is the destination or the
departure point for such magical travel. A
portal to another location, world, or plane
of existence, as well as an opening to an
extradimensional space such as that created
by the <a href="./rope_trick.html">rope trick</a> spell, temporarily closes
while in the sphere.</p>

<p><i><b>Creatures and Objects.</b></i> A creature or
object summoned or created by magic
temporarily winks out of existence in the
sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears
once the space the creature occupied is no
longer within the sphere.</p>

<p><i><b>Dispel Magic.</b></i> Spells and magical
effects such as <a href="./dispel_magic.html">dispel magic</a> have no effect
on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created
by different <a href="./antimagic_field.html">antimagic field</a> spells don't
nullify each other.</p>
