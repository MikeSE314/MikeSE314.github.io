<h1>Vampiric Touch</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level necromancy</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can
siphon life force from others to heal your
wounds. Make a melee spell attack against a
creature within your reach. On a hit, the
target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you
regain hit points equal to half the amount of
necrotic damage dealt. Until the spell ends,
you can make the attack again on each of your
turns as an
action.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 3rd.</p>
