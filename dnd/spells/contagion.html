<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 7 days</p>

<p>Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee
spell attack against a creature within your
reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature
with a disease of your choice from any of the
ones described below.</p>

<p>At the end of each of the target’s turns, it
must make a Constitution saving throw. After
failing three of these saving throws, the
disease’s effects last for the duration, and
the creature stops making these saves. After
succeeding on three of these saving throws,
the creature recovers from the disease, and
the spell ends.</p>

<p>Since this spell induces a natural disease in
its target, any effect that removes a disease
or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects
apply to it.</p>
