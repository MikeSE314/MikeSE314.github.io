<h1>Lightning Arrow</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>The next time you make a ranged weapon attack
during the spell’s duration, the weapon’s
ammunition, or the weapon itself if it’s a
thrown weapon, transforms into a bolt of
lightning. Make the attack roll as normal.
The target takes 4d8 lightning damage on a
hit, or half as much damage on a miss,
instead of the weapon’s normal
damage.</p>

<p>Whether you hit or miss, each creature within
10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity
saving throw. Each of these creatures takes
2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p>The piece of ammunition or weapon then
returns to its normal form.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
higher, the damage for both effects of the
spell increases by 1d8 for each slot level
above 3rd.</p>
