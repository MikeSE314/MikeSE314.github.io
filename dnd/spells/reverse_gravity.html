<h1>Reverse Gravity</h1>

<p><i>7th-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 100 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a lodestone and iron
filings)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>This spell reverses gravity in a
50-foot-radius, 100- foot high cylinder
centered on a point within range. All
creatures and objects that arenâ€™t somehow
anchored to the ground in the area fall
upward and reach the top of the area when you
cast this spell. A creature can make a
Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed
object it can reach, thus avoiding the
fall.</p>

<p>If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is
encountered in this fall, falling objects and
creatures strike it just as they would during
a normal downward fall. If an object or
creature reaches the top of the area without
striking anything, it remains there,
oscillating slightly, for the duration.</p>

<p>At the end of the duration, affected objects
and creatures fall back down.</p>
