<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (two lodestones)</p>

<p>This spell repairs a single break or tear in
an object you touch, such as a broken chain
link, two halves of a broken key, a torn
cloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the
break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any
dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of
the former damage.</p>

<p>This spell can physically repair a magic item
or construct, but the spell canâ€™t restore
magic to such an object.</p>
