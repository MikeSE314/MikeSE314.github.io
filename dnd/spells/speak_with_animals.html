<p>You gain the ability to comprehend and
verbally communicate with beasts for the
duration. The knowledge and awareness of many
beasts is limited by their intelligence, but

about nearby locations and monsters,

perceived within the past day. You might be
able to persuade a beast to perform a small
favor for you, at the DMâ€™s discretion.</p>
