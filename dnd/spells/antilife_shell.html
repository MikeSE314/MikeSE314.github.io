<p>A shimmering barrier extends out from you in
a 10-foot radius and moves with you,
remaining centered on you and hedging out
creatures other than undead and constructs.
The barrier lasts for the duration.</p>

<p>The barrier prevents an affected creature
from passing or reaching through. An affected
creature can cast spells or make attacks with
ranged or reach weapons through the barrier.</p>

<p>If you move so that an affected creature is
forced to pass through the barrier, the spell
ends.</p>
