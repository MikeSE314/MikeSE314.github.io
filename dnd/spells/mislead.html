<h1>Mislead</h1>

<p><i>5th-level illusion</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>You become invisible at the same time that an
illusory double of you appears where you are
standing. The double lasts for the duration,
but the invisibility ends if you attack or
cast a spell.</p>

<p>You can use your action to move your illusory
double up to twice your speed and make it
gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way
you choose.</p>

<p>You can see through its eyes and hear through
its ears as if you were located where it is.
On each of your turns as a bonus action, you
can switch from using its senses to using
your own, or back again. While you are using
its senses, you are blinded and deafened in
regard to your own surroundings.</p>
