<h1>Spirit Guardians</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self (15-foot radius)</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a holy symbol)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>You call forth spirits to protect you. They
flit around you to a distance of 15 feet for
the duration. If you are good or neutral,
their spectral form appears angelic or fey
(your choice). If you are evil, they appear
fiendish.</p>

<p>When you cast this spell, you can designate
any number of creatures you can see to be
unaffected by it. An affected creatureâ€™s
speed is halved in the area, and when the
creature enters the area for the first time
on a turn or starts its turn there, it must
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you
are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage
(if you are evil). On a successful save, the
creature takes half as much damage.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each
slot level above 3rd.</p>
