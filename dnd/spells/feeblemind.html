<p>You blast the mind of a creature that you can
see within range, attempting to shatter its
intellect and personality. The target takes
4d6 psychic damage and must make an
Intelligence saving throw.</p>

<p>On a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence
and Charisma scores become 1. The creature
can’t cast spells, activate magic items,
understand language, or communicate in any
intelligible way. The creature can, however,
identify its friends, follow them, and even
protect them.</p>

<p>At the end of every 30 days, the creature can
repeat its saving throw against this spell.
If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell
ends.</p>

<p>The spell can also be ended by greater
restoration, heal, or wish.</p>
