<h1>Cordon of Arrows</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 5 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (four or more arrows
or bolts)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 8 hours</p>

<p>You plant four pieces of nonmagical
ammunition—arrows or crossbow bolts—in the
ground within range and lay magic upon them
to protect an area. Until the spell ends,
whenever a creature other than you comes
within 30 feet of the ammunition for the
first time on a turn or ends its turn there,
one piece of ammunition flies up to strike
it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw or take 1d6 piercing damage. The
piece of ammunition is then destroyed. The
spell ends when no ammunition remains.</p>

<p>When you cast this spell, you can designate
any creatures you choose, and the spell
ignores them.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
higher, the amount of ammunition that can be
affected increases by two for each slot level
above 2nd.</p>
