<h1>Disintegrate</h1>

<p><i>6th-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>A thin green ray springs from your pointing
finger to a target that you can see within
range. The target can be a creature, an
object, or a creation of magical force, such
as the wall created by <a href="./wall_of_force.html">wall of force</a>.</p>

<p>A creature targeted by this spell must make a
Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If this
damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it
is disintegrated.</p>

<p>A disintegrated creature and everything it is
wearing and carrying, except magic items, are
reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The
creature can be restored to life only by
means of a <a href="./true_resurrection.html">true resurrection</a> or a <a href="./wish.html">wish</a>
spell.</p>

<p>This spell automatically disintegrates a
Large or smaller nonmagical object or a
creation of magical force. If the target is a
Huge or larger object or creation of force,
this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube
portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by
this spell.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each
slot level above 6th.</p>
