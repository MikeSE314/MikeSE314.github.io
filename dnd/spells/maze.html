<h1>Maze</h1>

<p><i>8th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>You banish a creature that you can see within
range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The
target remains there for the duration or
until it escapes the maze.</p>

<p>The target can use its action to attempt to
escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20
Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it
escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or
goristro demon automatically succeeds).</p>

<p>When the spell ends, the target reappears in
the space it left or, if that space is
occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>
