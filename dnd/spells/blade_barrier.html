<p>You create a vertical wall of whirling,
razor-sharp blades made of magical energy.
The wall appears within range and lasts for
the duration. You can make a straight wall up
to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet
thick, or a ringed wall up to 60 feet in
diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The
wall provides three-quarters cover to
creatures behind it, and its space is
difficult terrain.</p>

<p>When a creature enters the wallâ€™s area for
the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, the creature must make a Dexterity
saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful
save, the creature takes half as much damage.</p>
