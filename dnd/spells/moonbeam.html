<h1>Moonbeam</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 120 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (several seeds of any
moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent
feldspar)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a
5-foot- radius, 40-foot-high cylinder
centered on a point within range. Until the
spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.</p>

<p>When a creature enters the spell’s area for
the first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that
cause searing pain, and it must make a
Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10
radiant damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p>A shapechanger makes its saving throw with
disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly
reverts to its original form and can’t assume
a different form until it leaves the spell’s
light.</p>

<p>On each of your turns after you cast this
spell, you can use an action to move the beam
60 feet in any direction.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i>When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each
slot level above 2nd.</p>
