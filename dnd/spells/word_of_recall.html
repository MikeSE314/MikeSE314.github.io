<h1>Word of Recall</h1>

<p><i>6th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 5 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You and up to five willing creatures within 5
feet of you instantly teleport to a
previously designated sanctuary. You and any
creatures that teleport with you appear in
the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you
designated when you prepared your sanctuary
(see below). If you cast this spell without
first preparing a sanctuary, the spell has no
effect.</p>

<p>You must designate a sanctuary by casting
this spell within a location, such as a
temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to
your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell
in this manner in an area that isnâ€™t
dedicated to your deity, the spell has no
effect.</p>
