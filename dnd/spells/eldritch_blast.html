<p>A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a
creature within range. Make a ranged spell
attack against the target. On a hit, the
target takes 1d10 force damage.</p>

<p>The spell creates more than one beam when you
reach higher levels: two beams at 5th level,
three beams at 11th level, and four beams at
17th level. You can direct the beams at the
same target or at different ones. Make a
separate attack roll for each beam.</p>
