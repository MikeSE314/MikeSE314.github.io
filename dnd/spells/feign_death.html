<h1>Feign Death</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level necromancy (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a pinch of graveyard dirt)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour</p>

<p>You touch a willing creature and put it into
a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable
from death.</p>

<p>For the spell’s duration, or until you use an
action to touch the target and dismiss the
spell, the target appears dead to all outward
inspection and to spells used to determine
the target’s status. The target is blinded
and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0.
The target has resistance to all damage
except psychic damage. If the target is
diseased or poisoned when you cast the spell,
or becomes diseased or poisoned while under
the spell’s effect, the disease and poison
have no effect until the spell ends.</p>
