<h1>Dissonant Whispers</h1>

<p><i>1st-level enchantment</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You whisper a discordant melody that only one
creature of your choice within range can
hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The
target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and
must immediately use its reaction, if
available, to move as far as its speed allows
away from you. The creature doesn’t move into
obviously dangerous ground, such as a fire or
a pit. On a successful save, the target takes
half as much damage and doesn’t have to move
away. A deafened creature automatically
succeeds on the save.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 1st.</p>
