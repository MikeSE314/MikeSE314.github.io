<p>The next time you hit a creature with a
ranged weapon attack before the spell ends,
this spell creates a rain of thorns that
sprouts from your ranged weapon or
ammunition. In addition to the normal effect
of the attack, the target of the attack and
each creature within 5 feet of it must make a
Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 1d10
piercing damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> If you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each
slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6d10).</p>
