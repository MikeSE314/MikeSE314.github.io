<h1>Darkness</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>Magical darkness spreads from a point you
choose within range to fill a 15-foot-radius
sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads
around corners. A creature with darkvision
can’t see through this darkness, and
nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.</p>

<p>If the point you choose is on an object you
are holding or one that isn’t being worn or
carried, the darkness emanates from the
object and moves with it. Completely covering
the source of the darkness with an opaque
object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the
darkness.</p>

<p>If any of this spell’s area overlaps with an
area of light created by a spell of 2nd level
or lower, the spell that created the light is
dispelled.</p>
