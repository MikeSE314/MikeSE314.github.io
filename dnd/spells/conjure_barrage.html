<h1>Conjure Barrage</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self (60-foot cone)</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (one piece of
ammunition or a thrown weapon)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece
of nonmagical ammunition into the air to
create a cone of identical weapons that shoot
forward and then disappear. Each creature in
a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity
saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 damage on
a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. The damage type is the same
as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a
component.</p>
