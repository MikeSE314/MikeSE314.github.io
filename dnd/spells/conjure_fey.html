<h1>Conjure Fey</h1>

<p><i>6th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 90 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>You summon a fey creature of challenge rating
6 or lower, or a fey spirit that takes the
form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or
lower. It appears in an unoccupied space that
you can see within range. The fey creature
disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or
when the spell ends.</p>

<p>The fey creature is friendly to you and your
companions for the duration. Roll initiative
for the creature, which has its own turns. It
obeys any verbal commands that you issue to
it (no action required by you), as long as
they don't violate its alignment. If you
don’t issue any commands to the fey creature,
it defends itself from hostile creatures but
otherwise takes no actions.</p>

<p>If your concentration is broken, the fey
creature doesn’t disappear. Instead, you lose
control of the fey creature, it becom es
hostile toward you and your companions, and
it might attack. An uncontrolled fey creature
can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears
1 hour after you summoned it.</p>

<p>The DM has the fey creature’s statistics.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
higher, the challenge rating increases by 1
for each slot level above 6th.</p>
