<h1>Bestow Curse</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level necromancy</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You touch a creature, and that creature must
succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become
cursed for the duration of the spell. When
you cast this spell, choose the nature of the
curse from the following options:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Choose one ability score. While cursed, the
    target has disadvantage on ability checks
    and saving throws made with that ability
    score.</li>

    <li>While cursed, the target has disadvantage
        on attack rolls against you.</li>

    <li>While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom
    saving throw at the start of each of its
    turns. If it fails, it wastes its action
    that turn doing nothing.</li>

    <li>While the target is cursed, your attacks
    and spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic
    damage to the target.</li>
</ul>

<p>A <a href="./remove_curse.html">remove curse</a> spell ends this effect. At
the DM’s option, you may choose an
alternative curse effect, but it should be no
more powerful than those described above. The
DM has final say on such a curse’s effect.</p>
