<h1>Spike Growth</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 150 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (seven sharp thorns
or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a
point)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a
point within range twists and sprouts hard
spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult
terrain for the duration. When a creature
moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4
piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.</p>

<p>The transformation of the ground is
camouflaged to look natural. Any creature
that canâ€™t see the area at the time the spell
is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check
against your spell save DC to recognize the
terrain as hazardous before entering it.</p>
