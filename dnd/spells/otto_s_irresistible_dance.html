<h1>Otto’s Irresistible Dance</h1>

<p><i>6th-level enchantment</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>Choose one creature that you can see within
range. The target begins a comic dance in
place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and
capering for the duration. Creatures that
can’t be charmed are immune to this spell.</p>

<p>A dancing creature must use all its movement
to dance without leaving its space and has
disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws and
attack rolls. While the target is affected by
this spell, other creatures have advantage on
attack rolls against it. As an action, a
dancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw
to regain control of itself. On a successful
save, the spell ends.</p>
