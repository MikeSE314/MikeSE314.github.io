<h1>Sleep</h1>

<p><i>1st-level enchantment</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 90 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a pinch of fine
sand, rose petals, or a cricket)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p>This spell sends creatures into a magical
slumber. Roll 5d8; the total is how many hit
points of creatures this spell can affect.
Creatures within 20 feet of a point you
choose within range are affected in ascending
order of their current hit points (ignoring
unconscious
creatures).</p>

<p>Starting with the creature that has the
lowest current hit points, each creature
affected by this spell falls unconscious
until the spell ends, the sleeper takes
damage, or someone uses an action to shake or
slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each
creature’s hit points from the total before
moving on to the creature with the next
lowest hit points. A creature’s hit points
must be equal to or less than the remaining
total for that creature to be affected.</p>

<p>Undead and creatures immune to being charmed
aren’t affected by this spell.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot
level above 1st.</p>
