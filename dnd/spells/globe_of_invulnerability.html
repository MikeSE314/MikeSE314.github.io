<h1>Globe of Invulnerability</h1>

<p><i>6th-level abjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self (10-foot radius)</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier
springs into existence in a 10-foot radius
around you and remains for the duration.</p>

<p>Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from
outside the barrier can't affect creatures or
objects within it, even if the spell is cast
using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell
can target creatures and objects within the
barrier, but the spell has no effect on them.
Similarly, the area within the barrier is
excluded from the areas affected by such
spells.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
higher, the barrier blocks spells of one
level higher for each slot level above 6th.</p>
