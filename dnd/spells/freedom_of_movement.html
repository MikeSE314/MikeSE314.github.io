<h1>Freedom of Movement</h1>

<p><i>4th-level abjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour</p>

<p>You touch a willing creature. For the
duration, the target’s movement is unaffected
by difficult terrain, and spells and other
magical effects can neither reduce the
target’s speed nor cause the target to be
paralyzed or restrained.</p>

<p>The target can also spend 5 feet of movement
to automatically escape from nonmagical
restraints, such as manacles or a creature
that has it grappled. Finally, being
underwater imposes no penalties on the
target's movement or attacks.</p>
