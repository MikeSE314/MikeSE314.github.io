<p>Life-preserving energy radiates from you in
an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until the
spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered
on you. Each nonhostile creature in the aura
(including you) has resistance to necrotic
damage, and its hit point maximum can't be
reduced. In addition, a nonhostile, living
creature regains 1 hit point when it starts
its turn in the aura with 0 hit
points.</p>
