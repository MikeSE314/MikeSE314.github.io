<h1>Dancing Lights</h1>

<p><i>Evocation cantrip</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 120 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or wychwood, or a glowworm)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You create up to four torch-sized lights
within range, making them appear as torches,
lanterns, or glowing orbs that hover in the
air for the duration. You can also combine
the four lights into one glowing vaguely
humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form
you choose, each light sheds dim light in a
10-foot radius.</p>

<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move
the lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within
range. A light must be within 20 feet of
another light created by this spell, and a
light winks out if it exceeds the spellâ€™s
range.</p>
