<h1>Divine Word</h1>

<p><i>7th-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You utter a divine word, imbued with the
power that shaped the world at the dawn of
creation. Choose any number of creatures you
can see within range. Each creature that can
hear you must make a Charisma saving throw.
On a failed save, a creature suffers an
effect based on its current hit
points:</p>

<ul>
<li>50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1
    minute</li>

<li>40 hit points or fewer: deafened and
    blinded for 10 minutes</li>

<li>30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened,
    and stunned for 1 hour</li>

<li>20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly</li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of its current hit points, a
celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend
that fails its save is forced back to its
plane of origin (if it isn’t there already)
and can’t return to your current plane for 24
hours by any means short of a <a href="./wish.html">wish</a> spell.</p>
