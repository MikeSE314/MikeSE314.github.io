<h1>Heroes’ Feast</h1>

<p><i>6th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a gem-encrusted bowl
worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell
consumes)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You bring forth a great feast, including
magnificent food and drink. The feast takes 1
hour to consume and disappears at the end of
that time, and the beneficial effects don’t
set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve
other creatures can partake of the feast.</p>

<p>A creature that partakes of the feast gains
several benefits. The creature is cured of
all diseases and poison, becomes immune to
poison and being frightened, and makes all
Wisdom saving throws with advantage. Its hit
point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it
gains the same number of hit points. These
benefits last for 24 hours.</p>
