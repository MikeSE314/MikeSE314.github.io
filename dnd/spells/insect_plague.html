<h1>Insect Plague</h1>

<p><i>5th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 300 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a few grains of
sugar, some kernels of grain, and a smear of
fat)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>Swarming, biting locusts fill a
20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you
choose within range. The sphere spreads
around corners. The sphere remains for the
duration, and its area is lightly obscured.
The sphere’s area is difficult
terrain.</p>

<p>W hen the area appears, each creature in it
must make a Constitution saving throw. A
creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. A creature must also make
this saving throw when it enters the spell’s
area for the first time on a turn or ends its
turn there.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each
slot level above 5th.</p>
