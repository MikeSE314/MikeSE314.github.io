<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p>A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers
for the duration in an unoccupied space of
your choice that you can see within range.
The guardian occupies that space and is
indistinct except for a gleaming sword and
shield emblazoned with the symbol of your
deity.</p>

<p>Any creature hostile to you that moves to a
space within 10 feet of the guardian for the
first time on a turn must succeed on a
Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 20
radiant damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. The guardian
vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60
damage.</p>
