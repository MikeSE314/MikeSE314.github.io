<h1>Fireball</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 150 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>A bright streak flashes from your pointing
finger to a point you choose within range and
then blossoms with a low roar into an
explosion of flame. Each creature in a
20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target
takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful
one.</p>

<p>The fire spreads around corners. It ignites
flammable objects in the area that aren't
being worn or carried.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 3rd.</p>
