<h1>Creation</h1>

<p><i>5th-level illusion</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a tiny piece of
matter of the same type of the item you plan
to create)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Special</p>

<p>You pull wisps of shadow material from the
Shadowfell to create a nonliving object of
vegetable matter within range: soft goods,
rope, wood, or something similar. You can
also use this spell to create mineral objects
such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object
created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube,
and the object must be of a form and material
that you have seen before.</p>

<p>The duration depends on the object’s
material. If the object is composed of
multiple materials, use the shortest
duration.</p>

<p>|Material             |Duration  |
|:--------------------|:---------|
|Vegetable matter     |1 day     |
|Stone or crystal     |12 hours  |
|Precious metals      |1 hour    |
|Gems                 |10 minutes|
|Adamantine or mithral|1 minute  |</p>

<p>Using any material created by this spell as
another spell’s material component causes
that spell to fail.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each
slot level above 5th.</p>
