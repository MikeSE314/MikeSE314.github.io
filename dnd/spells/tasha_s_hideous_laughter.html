<h1>Tasha’s Hideous Laughter</h1>

<p><i>1st-level enchantment</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (tiny tarts and a
feather that is waved in the air)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>A creature of your choice that you can see
within range perceives everything as
hilariously funny and falls into fits of
laughter if this spell affects it. The target
must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall
prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to
stand up for the duration. A creature with an
Intelligence score of 4 or less isn’t
affected.</p>

<p>At the end of each of its turns, and each
time it takes damage, the target can make
another Wisdom saving throw. The target has
advantage on the saving throw if it’s
triggered by damage. On a success, the spell
ends.</p>
