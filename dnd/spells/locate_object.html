<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a forked twig)</p>

<p>Describe or name an object that is familiar
to you. You sense the direction to the
object’s location, as long as that object is
within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in
motion, you know the direction of its
movement.</p>

<p>The spell can locate a specific object known
to you, as long as you have seen it up
close—within 30 feet—at least once.
Alternatively, the spell can locate the
nearest object of a particular kind, such as
a certain kind of apparel, jewelry,
furniture, tool, or weapon.</p>

<p>This spell can’t locate an object if any
thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks
a direct path between you and the object.</p>
