<h1>Calm Emotions</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level enchantment</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a
group of people. Each humanoid in a
20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you
choose within range must make a Charisma
saving throw; a creature can choose to fail
this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature
fails its saving throw, choose one of the
following two effects.</p>

<p>You can suppress any effect causing a target
to be charmed or frightened. When this spell
ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided
that its duration has not expired in the
meantime.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can make a target
indifferent about creatures of your choice
that it is hostile toward. This indifference
ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a
spell or if it witnesses any of its friends
being harmed. When the spell ends, the
creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM
rules otherwise.</p>
