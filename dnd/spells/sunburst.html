<p><i>8th-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

sunstone)</p>

<p>Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot
radius centered on a point you choose within
range. Each creature in that light must make
a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage
and is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful
save, it takes half as much damage and isnâ€™t
blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have
disadvantage on this saving
throw.</p>

<p>A creature blinded by this spell makes
another Constitution saving throw at the end
of each of its turns. On a successful save,
it is no longer blinded.</p>

<p>This spell dispels any darkness in its area
that was created by a spell.</p>
