<p><i>Transmutation cantrip</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (mistletoe, a
shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p>The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are
holding is imbued with nature’s power. For
the duration, you can use your spellcasting
ability instead of Strength for the attack
and damage rolls of melee attacks using that
weapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes a
d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it
isn’t already. The spell ends if you cast it
again or if you let go of the
weapon.</p>
