<h1>Guiding Bolt</h1>

<p><i>1st-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 120 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 round</p>

<p>A flash of light streaks toward a creature of
your choice within range. Make a ranged spell
attack against the target. On a hit, the
target takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next
attack roll made against this target before
the end of your next turn has advantage,
thanks to the mystical dim light glittering
on the target until then.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 1st.</p>
