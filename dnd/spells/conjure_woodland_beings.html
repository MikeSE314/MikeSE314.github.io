<h1>Conjure Woodland Beings</h1>

<p><i>4th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (one holly berry per
creature summoned)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>You summon fey creatures that appear in
unoccupied spaces that you can see within
range. Choose one of the following options
for what appears:</p>

<ul>
<li>One fey creature of challenge rating 2 or
    lower</li>

<li>Two fey creatures of challenge rating 1 or
    lower</li>

<li>Four fey creatures of challenge rating 1/2
    or lower • Eight fey creatures of
    challenge rating 1/4 or lower</li>
</ul>

<p>A summoned creature disappears when it drops
to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.</p>

<p>The summoned creatures are friendly to you
and your companions. Roll initiative for the
summoned creatures as a group, which have
their own turns. They obey any verbal
commands that you issue to them (no action
required by you). If you don't issue any
commands to them, they defend themselves from
hostile creatures, but otherwise take no
actions.</p>

<p>The DM has the creatures’ statistics.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using certain higher-level spell slots,
you choose one of the summoning options
above, and more creatures appear: twice as
many with a 6th-level slot and three times as
many with an 8th-level slot.</p>
