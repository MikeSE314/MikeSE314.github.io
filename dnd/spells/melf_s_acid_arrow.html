<h1>Melf’s Acid Arrow</h1>

<p><b>Range:</b> 90 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (powdered rhubarb
leaf and an adder’s stomach)</p>

<p>A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a
target within range and bursts in a spray of
acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the
target. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid
damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the
end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow
splashes the target with acid for half as
much of the initial damage and no damage at
the end of its next turn.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
higher, the damage (both initial and later)
increases by 1d4 for each slot level above
2nd.</p>
