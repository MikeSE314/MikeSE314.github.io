<h1>True Resurrection</h1>

<p><i>9th-level necromancy</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 hour</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy
water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp,
which the spell consumes)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You touch a creature that has been dead for
no longer than 200 years and that died for
any reason except old age. If the creature’s
soul is free and willing, the creature is
restored to life with all its hit
points.</p>

<p>This spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any
poison, cures all diseases, and lifts any
curses affecting the creature when it died.
The spell replaces damaged or missing organs
and limbs.</p>

<p>The spell can even provide a new body if the
original no longer exists, in which case you
must speak the creature’s name. The creature
then appears in an unoccupied space you
choose within 10 feet of you.</p>
