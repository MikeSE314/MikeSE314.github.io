<h1>Find Traps</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level divination</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 120 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You sense the presence of any trap within
range that is within line of sight. A trap,
for the purpose of this spell, includes
anything that would inflict a sudden or
unexpected effect you consider harmful or
undesirable, which was specifically intended
as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would
sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a
glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap,
but it would not reveal a natural weakness in
the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden
sinkhole.</p>

<p>This spell merely reveals that a trap is
present. You donâ€™t learn the location of each
trap, but you do learn the general nature of
the danger posed by a trap you sense.</p>
