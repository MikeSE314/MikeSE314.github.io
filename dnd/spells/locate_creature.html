<h1>Locate Creature</h1>

<p><i>4th-level divination</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a bit of fur from a bloodhound)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>Describe or name a creature that is familiar
to you. You sense the direction to the
creature’s location, as long as that creature
is within 1,000 feet of you. If the creature
is moving, you know the direction of its
movement.</p>

<p>The spell can locate a specific creature
known to you, or the nearest creature of a
specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn),
so long as you have seen such a creature up
close—within 30 feet—at least once. If the
creature you described or named is in a
different form, such as being under the
effects of a <a href="./polymorph.html">polymorph</a> spell, this spell
doesn’t locate the creature.</p>

<p>This spell can’t locate a creature if running
water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct
path between you and the creature.</p>
