<h1>Gentle Repose</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level necromancy (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 10 days</p>

<p>You touch a corpse or other remains. For the
duration, the target is protected from decay
and can’t become undead.</p>

<p>The spell also effectively extends the time
limit on raising the target from the dead,
since days spent under the influence of this
spell don’t count against the time limit of
spells such as raise dead.</p>
