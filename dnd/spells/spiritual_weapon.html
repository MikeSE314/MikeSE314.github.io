<h1>Spiritual Weapon</h1>

<p>You create a floating, spectral weapon within
range that lasts for the duration or until
you cast this spell again. When you cast the
spell, you can make a melee spell attack
against a creature within 5 feet of the
weapon. On a hit, the target takes force
damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting
ability modifier.</p>

<p>As a bonus action on your turn, you can move
the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the
attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.</p>

<p>The weapon can take whatever form you choose.
Clerics of deities who are associated with a
particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known
for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make
this spellâ€™s effect resemble that weapon.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every
two slot levels above the 2nd.</p>
