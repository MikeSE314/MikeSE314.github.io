<h1>Nystul’s Magic Aura</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level illusion</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a small square of
silk)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 24 hours</p>

<p>You place an illusion on a creature or an
object you touch so that divination spells
reveal false information about it. The target
can be a willing creature or an object that
isn’t being carried or worn by another
creature.</p>

<p>When you cast the spell, choose one or both
of the following effects. The effect lasts
for the duration. If you cast this spell on
the same creature or object every day for 30
days, placing the same effect on it each
time, the illusion lasts until it is
dispelled.</p>

<p><i><b>False Aura.</b></i> You change the way the
target appears to spells and magical effects,
such as <a href="./detect_magic.html">detect magic</a>, that detect magical
auras. You can make a nonmagical object
appear magical, a magical object appear
nonmagical, or change the object’s magical
aura so that it appears to belong to a
specific school of magic that you choose.
When you use this effect on an object, you
can make the false magic apparent to any
creature that handles the item.</p>

<p><i><b>Mask.</b></i> You change the way the target
appears to spells and magical effects that
detect creature types, such as a paladin’s
Divine Sense or the trigger of a <a href="./symbol.html">symbol</a>
spell. You choose a creature type and other
spells and magical effects treat the target
as if it were a creature of that type or of
that alignment.</p>
