<p>The next time you hit a creature with a
weapon attack before this spell ends, the
weapon gleams with astral radiance as you
strike. The attack deals an extra 2d6 radiant
damage to the target, which becomes visible
if it’s invisible, and the target sheds dim
light in a 5-foot radius and can’t become
invisible until the spell ends.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
higher, the extra damage increases by 1d6 for
each slot level above 2nd.</p>
