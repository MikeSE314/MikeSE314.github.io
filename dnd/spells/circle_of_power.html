<h1>Circle of Power</h1>

<p><i>5th-level abjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self (30-foot radius)</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>Divine energy radiates from you, distorting
and diffusing magical energy within 30 feet
of you. Until the spell ends, the sphere
moves with you, centered on you. For the
duration, each friendly creature in the area
(including you) has advantage on saving
throws against spells and other magical
effects. Additionally, when an affected
creature succeeds on a saving throw made
against a spell or magical effect that allows
it to make a saving throw to take only half
damage, it instead takes no damage if it
succeeds on the saving throw.</p>
