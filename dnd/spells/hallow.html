<h1>Hallow</h1>

<p><i>5th-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 24 hours</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (herbs, oils, and
incense worth at least 1,000 gp, which the
spell consumes)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Until dispelled</p>

<p>You touch a point and infuse an area around
it with holy (or unholy) power. The area can
have a radius up to 60 feet, and the spell
fails if the radius includes an area already
under the effect a <a href="./hallow.html">hallow</a> spell. The
affected area is subject to the following
effects.</p>

<p>First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends,
and undead can’t enter the area, nor can such
creatures charm, frighten, or possess
creatures within it. Any creature charmed,
frightened, or possessed by such a creature
is no longer charmed, frightened, or
possessed upon entering the area. You can
exclude one or more of those types of
creatures from this effect.</p>

<p>Second, you can bind an extra effect to the
area. Choose the effect from the following
list, or choose an effect offered by the DM.
Some of these effects apply to creatures in
the area; you can designate whether the
effect applies to all creatures, creatures
that follow a specific deity or leader, or
creatures of a specific sort, such as ores or
trolls. When a creature that would be
affected enters the spell’s area for the
first time on a turn or starts its turn
there, it can make a Charisma saving throw.
On a success, the creature ignores the extra
effect until it leaves the area.</p>

<p><i><b>Courage.</b></i> Affected creatures can’t be
frightened while in the area.</p>

<p><i><b>Darkness.</b></i> Darkness fills the area.
Normal light, as well as magical light
created by spells of a lower level than the
slot you used to cast this spell, can’t
illuminate the area.</p>

<p><i><b>Daylight.</b></i> Bright light fills the area.
Magical darkness created by spells of a lower
level than the slot you used to cast this
spell can’t extinguish the light.</p>

<p><i><b>Energy Protection.</b></i> Affected creatures
in the area have resistance to one damage
type of your choice, except for bludgeoning,
piercing, or slashing.</p>

<p><i><b>Energy Vulnerability.</b></i> Affected
creatures in the area have vulnerability to
one damage type of your choice, except for
bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.</p>

<p><i><b>Everlasting Rest.</b></i> Dead bodies interred
in the area can’t be turned into undead.</p>

<p><i><b>Extradimensional Interference.</b></i> Affected
creatures can’t move or travel using
teleportation or by extradimensional or
interplanar means.</p>

<p><i><b>Fear.</b></i> Affected creatures are frightened
while in the area.</p>

<p><i><b>Silence.</b></i> No sound can emanate from
within the area, and no sound can reach into
it.</p>

<p><i><b>Tongues.</b></i> Affected creatures can
communicate with any other creature in the
area, even if they don’t share a common
language.</p>
