<h1>Chain Lightning</h1>

<p><i>6th-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 150 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and three silver pins)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You create a bolt of lightning that arcs
toward a target of your choice that you can
see within range. Three bolts then leap from
that target to as many as three other
targets, each of which must be within 30 feet
of the first target. A target can be a
creature or an object and can be targeted by
only one of the bolts.</p>

<p>A target must make a Dexterity saving throw.
The target takes 10d8 lightning damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
higher, one additional bolt leaps from the
first target to another target for each slot
level above 6th.</p>
