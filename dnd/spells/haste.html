<h1>Haste</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a shaving of licorice root)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>Choose a willing creature that you can see
within range. Until the spell ends, the
target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2
bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity
saving throws, and it gains an additional
action on each of its turns. That action can
be used only to take the Attack (one weapon
attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use
an Object action.</p>

<p>When the spell ends, the target can’t move or
take actions until after its next turn, as a
wave of lethargy sweeps over it.</p>
