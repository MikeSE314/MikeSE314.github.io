<h1>Mordenkainen’s Faithful Hound</h1>

<p><i>4th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a tiny silver
whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 8 hours</p>

<p>You conjure a phantom watchdog in an
unoccupied space that you can see within
range, where it remains for the duration,
until you dismiss it as an action, or until
you move more than 100 feet away from
it.</p>

<p>The hound is invisible to all creatures
except you and can't be harmed. When a Small
or larger creature com es within 30 feet of
it without first speaking the password that
you specify when you cast this spell, the
hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees
invisible creatures and can see into the
Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.</p>

<p>At the start of each of your turns, the hound
attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet
of it that is hostile to you. The hound’s
attack bonus is equal to your spellcasting
ability modifier + your proficiency bonus. On
a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.</p>
