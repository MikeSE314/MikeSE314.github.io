<h1>Contingency</h1>

<p><i>6th-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 10 days</p>

<p>Choose a spell of 5th level or lower that you
can cast, that has a casting time of 1
action, and that can target you. You cast
that spell—called the contingent spell—as
part of casting <a href="./contingency.html">contingency</a>, expending
spell slots for both, but the contingent
spell doesn't come into effect. Instead, it
takes effect when a certain circumstance
occurs.  You describe that circumstance when
you cast the two spells. For example, a
<a href="./contingency.html">contingency</a> cast with <a href="./water_breathing.html">water breathing</a>
might stipulate that water breathing comes
into effect when you are engulfed in water or
a similar liquid.</p>

<p>The contingent spell takes effect immediately
after the circumstance is met for the first
time, whether or not you want it to, and then
<a href="./contingency.html">contingency</a> ends.</p>

<p>The contingent spell takes effect only on
you, even if it can normally target others.
You can use only one <a href="./contingency.html">contingency</a> spell at a
time. If you cast this spell again, the
effect of another <a href="./contingency.html">contingency</a> spell on you
ends. Also, <a href="./contingency.html">contingency</a> ends on you if its
material component is ever not on your
person.</p>
