<h1>Death Ward</h1>

<p><i>4th-level abjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 8 hours</p>

<p>You touch a creature and grant it a measure
of protection from death.</p>

<p>The first time the target would drop to 0 hit
points as a result of taking damage, the
target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the
spell ends.</p>

<p>If the spell is still in effect when the
target is subjected to an effect that would
kill it instantaneously without dealing
damage, that effect is instead negated
against the target, and the spell ends.</p>
