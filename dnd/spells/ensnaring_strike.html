<h1>Ensnaring Strike</h1>

<p><i>1st-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>The next time you hit a creature with a
weapon attack before this spell ends, a
writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the
point of impact, and the target must succeed
on a Strength saving throw or be restrained
by the magical vines until the spell ends. A
Large or larger creature has advantage on
this saving throw. If the target succeeds on
the save, the vines shrivel away.</p>

<p>While restrained by this spell, the target
takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of
each of its turns. A creature restrained by
the vines or one that can touch the creature
can use its action to make a Strength check
against your spell save DC. On a success, the
target is freed.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> If you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 1st.</p>
