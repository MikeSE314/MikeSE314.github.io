<h1>Find the Path</h1>

<p><i>6th-level divination</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools—such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes— worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 day</p>

<p>This spell allows you to find the shortest,
most direct physical route to a specific
fixed location that you are familiar with on
the same plane of existence. If you name a
destination on another plane of existence, a
destination that moves (such as a mobile
fortress), or a destination that isn’t
specific (such as “a green dragon’s lair”),
the spell fails.</p>

<p>For the duration, as long as you are on the
same plane of existence as the destination,
you know how far it is and in what direction
it lies. While you are traveling there,
whenever you are presented with a choice of
paths along the way, you automatically
determine which path is the shortest and most
direct route (but not necessarily the safest
route) to the destination.</p>
