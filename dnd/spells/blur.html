<h1>Blur</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level illusion</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>Your body becomes blurred, shifting and
wavering to all who can see you. For the
duration, any creature has disadvantage on
attack rolls against you. An attacker is
immune to this effect if it doesnâ€™t rely on
sight, as with blindsight, or can see through
illusions, as with truesight.</p>
