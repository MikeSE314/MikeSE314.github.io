<h1>Harm</h1>

<p><i>6th-level necromancy</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You unleash a virulent disease on a creature
that you can see within range. The target
must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage,
or half as much damage on a successful save.
The damage can’t reduce the target’s hit
points below 1. If the target fails the
saving throw, its hit point maximum is
reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the
necrotic damage it took. Any effect that
removes a disease allows a creature’s hit
point maximum to return to normal before that
time passes.</p>
