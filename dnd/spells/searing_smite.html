<h1>Searing Smite</h1>

<p><i>1st-level evocation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 bonus action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>The next time you hit a creature with a melee
weapon attack during the spellâ€™s duration,
your weapon flares with white-hot intensity,
and the attack deals an extra 1d6 fire damage
to the target and causes the target to ignite
in flames. At the start of each of its turns
until the spell ends, the target must make a
Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
it takes 1d6 fire damage. On a successful
save, the spell ends. If the target or a
creature within 5 feet of it uses an action
to put out the flames, or if some other
effect douses the flames (such as the target
being submerged in water), the spell
ends.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the
attack increases by 1d6 for each slot level
above 1st.</p>
