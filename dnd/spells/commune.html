<h1>Commune</h1>

<p><i>5th-level divination (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p>You contact your deity or a divine proxy and
ask up to three questions that can be
answered with a yes or no. You must ask your
questions before the spell ends. You receive
a correct answer for each question.</p>

<p>Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient,
so you might receive “unclear” as an answer
if a question pertains to information that
lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case
where a one-word answer could be misleading
or contrary to the deity’s interests, the DM
might offer a short phrase as an answer
instead.</p>

<p>If you cast the spell two or more times
before finishing your next long rest, there
is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each
casting after the first that you get no
answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.</p>
