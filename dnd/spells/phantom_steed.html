<h1>Phantom Steed</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level illusion (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour</p>

<p>A Large quasi-real, horselike creature
appears on the ground in an unoccupied space
of your choice within range. You decide the
creatureâ€™s appearance, but it is equipped
with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the
equipment created by the spell vanishes in a
puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10
feet away from the steed.</p>

<p>For the duration, you or a creature you
choose can ride the steed. The creature uses
the statistics for a riding horse, except it
has a speed of 100 feet and can travel 10
miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace.
When the spell ends, the steed gradually
fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount.
The spell ends if you use an action to
dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.</p>
