<h1>Scrying</h1>

<p><i>5th-level divination</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a focus worth at
least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a
silver mirror, or a font filled with holy
water)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>You can see and hear a particular creature
you choose that is on the same plane of
existence as you. The target must make a
Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how
well you know the target and the sort of
physical connection you have to it. If a
target knows you're casting this spell, it
can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it
wants to be observed.</p>

<p>|Knowledge                                |Save Modifier|
|:----------------------------------------|:-----------:|
|Secondhand (you have heard of the target)|     +5      |
|Firsthand (you have met the target)      |     +0      |
|Familiar (you know the target well)      |     -5      |</p>

<p>|Connection                                       |Save Modifier|
|:------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|
|Likeness or picture                              |     -2      |
|Possession or garment                            |     -4      |
|Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like|    -10      |</p>

<p>On a successful save, the target isn’t
affected, and you can’t use this spell
against it again for 24 hours.</p>

<p>On a failed save, the spell creates an
invisible sensor within 10 feet of the
target. You can see and hear through the
sensor as if you were there. The sensor moves
with the target, remaining within 10 feet of
it for the duration. A creature that can see
invisible objects sees the sensor as a
luminous orb about the size of your fist.</p>

<p>Instead of targeting a creature, you can
choose a location you have seen before as the
target of this spell. When you do, the sensor
appears at that location and doesn’t move.</p>
