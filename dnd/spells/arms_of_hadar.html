<h1>Arms of Hadar</h1>

<p><i>1st-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self (10-foot radius)</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>You invoke the power of Hadar, the Dark
Hunger. Tendrils of dark energy erupt from
you and batter all creatures within 10 feet
of you. Each creature in that area must make
a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a
target takes 2d6 necrotic damage and canâ€™t
take reactions until its next turn. On a
successful save, the creature takes half
damage, but suffers no other effect.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each
slot level above 1st.</p>
