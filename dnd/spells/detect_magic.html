<h1>Detect Magic</h1>

<p><i>1st-level divination (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>For the duration, you sense the presence of
magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense
magic in this way, you can use your action to
see a faint aura around any visible creature
or object in the area that bears magic, and
you learn its school of magic, if any.</p>

<p>The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it
is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of
common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet
of wood or dirt.</p>
