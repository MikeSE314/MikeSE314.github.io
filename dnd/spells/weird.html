<h1>Weird</h1>

<p><i>9th-level illusion</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 120 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to one minute</p>

<p>Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of
creatures, you create illusory creatures in
their minds, visible only to them. Each
creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered
on a point of your choice within range must
make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
a creature becomes frightened for the
duration. The illusion calls on the
creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its
worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At
the start of each of the frightened
creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom
saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On
a successful save, the spell ends for that
creature.</p>
