<h1>Contact Other Plane</h1>

<p><i>5th-level divination (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p>You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of
a long-dead sage, or some other mysterious
entity from another plane. Contacting this
extraplanar intelligence can strain or even
break your mind. When you cast this spell,
make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a
failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are
insane until you finish a long rest. While
insane, you can’t take actions, can’t
understand what other creatures say, can’t
read, and speak only in gibberish. A
<i>greater restoration</i> spell cast on you ends
this effect.</p>

<p>On a successful save, you can ask the entity
up to five questions. You must ask your
questions before the spell ends. The DM
answers each question with one word, such as
“yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,”
or “unclear” (if the entity doesn’t know the
answer to the question). If a one-word answer
would be misleading, the DM might instead
offer a short phrase as an answer.</p>
