<h1>Conjure Minor Elementals</h1>

<p><i>4th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 90 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>You summon elementals that appear in
unoccupied spaces that you can see within
range. You choose one the following options
for what appears:</p>

<ul>
<li>One elemental of challenge rating 2 or
    lower</li>

<li>Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or
    lower</li>

<li>Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or
    lower • Eight elementals of challenge
    rating 1/4 or lower.</li>
</ul>

<p>An elemental summoned by this spell
disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or
when the spell ends.</p>

<p>The summoned creatures are friendly to you
and your companions. Roll initiative for the
summoned creatures as a group, which has its
own turns. They obey any verbal commands that
you issue to them (no action required by
you). If you don’t issue any commands to
them, they defend themselves from hostile
creatures, but otherwise take no actions.</p>

<p>The DM has the creatures' statistics.
<i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using certain higher-level spell slots,
you choose one of the summoning options
above, and more creatures appear: twice as
many with a 6th-level slot and three times as
many with an 8th-level slot.</p>
