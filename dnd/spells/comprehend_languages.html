<h1>Comprehend Languages</h1>

<p><i>1st-level divination (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour</p>

<p>For the duration, you understand the literal
meaning of any spoken language that you hear.
You also understand any written language that
you see, but you must be touching the surface
on which the words are written. It takes
about 1 minute to read one page of
text.</p>

<p>This spell doesn’t decode secret messages in
a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil,
that isn’t part of a written language.</p>
