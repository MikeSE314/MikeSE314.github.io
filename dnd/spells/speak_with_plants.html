<h1>Speak with Plants</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level transmutation</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self (30-foot radius)</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 10 minutes</p>

<p>You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with
limited sentience and animation, giving them
the ability to communicate with you and
follow your simple commands. You can question
plants about events in the spell’s area
within the past day, gaining information
about creatures that have passed, weather,
and other circumstances.</p>

<p>You can also turn difficult terrain caused by
plant growth (such as thickets and
undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts
for the duration. Or you can turn ordinary
terrain where plants are present into
difficult terrain that lasts for the
duration, causing vines and branches to
hinder pursuers, for example.</p>

<p>Plants might be able to perform other tasks
on your behalf, at the DM’s discretion. The
spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot
themselves and move about, but they can
freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks.</p>

<p>If a plant creature is in the area, you can
communicate with it as if you shared a com m
on language, but you gain no magical ability
to influence it.</p>

<p>This spell can cause the plants created by
the <a href="./entangle.html">entangle</a> spell to release a restrained
creature.</p>
