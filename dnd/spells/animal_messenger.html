<h1>Animal Messenger</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level enchantment (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a morsel of food)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 24 hours</p>

<p>By means of this spell, you use an animal to
deliver a message. Choose a Tiny beast you
can see within range, such as a squirrel, a
blue jay, or a bat. You specify a location,
which you must have visited, and a recipient
who matches a general description, such as “a
man or woman dressed in the uniform of the
town guard” or “a red-haired dwarf wearing a
pointed hat.” You also speak a message of up
to twenty-five words. The target beast
travels for the duration of the spell toward
the specified location, covering about 50
miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or
25 miles for other animals.</p>

<p>When the messenger arrives, it delivers your
message to the creature that you described,
replicating the sound of your voice. The
messenger speaks only to a creature matching
the description you gave. If the messenger
doesn't reach its destination before the
spell ends, the message is lost, and the
beast makes its way back to where you cast
this spell.</p>

<p><b>At Higher Levels.</b> If you cast this spell
using a spell slot of 3nd level or higher,
the duration of the spell increases by 48
hours for each slot level above 2nd.</p>
