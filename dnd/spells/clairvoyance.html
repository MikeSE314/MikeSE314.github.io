<h1>Clairvoyance</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level divination</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 10 minutes</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 1 mile</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a focus worth at
least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for
hearing or a glass eye for seeing)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>You create an invisible sensor within range
in a location familiar to you (a place you
have visited or seen before) or in an obvious
location that is unfamiliar to you (such as
behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove
of trees). The sensor remains in place for
the duration, and it canâ€™t be attacked or
otherwise interacted with.</p>

<p>When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or
hearing. You can use the chosen sense through
the sensor as if you were in its space. As
your action, you can switch between seeing
and hearing.</p>

<p>A creature that can see the sensor (such as a
creature benefiting from see <a href="./invisibility.html">invisibility</a>
or truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb
about the size of your fist.</p>
