<h1>Blight</h1>

<p><i>4th-level necromancy</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Instantaneous</p>

<p>Necromantic energy washes over a creature of
your choice that you can see within range,
draining moisture and vitality from it. The
target must make a Constitution saving throw.
The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. This spell has no effect on
undead or constructs.</p>

<p>If you target a plant creature or a magical
plant, it makes the saving throw with
disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum
damage to it.</p>

<p>If you target a nonmagical plant that isn’t a
creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn’t
make a saving throw; it simply withers and
dies.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 5th level or
higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each
slot level above 4th.</p>
