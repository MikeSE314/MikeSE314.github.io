<h1>Conjure Celestial</h1>

<p><i>7th-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 90 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>You summon a celestial of challenge rating 4
or lower, which appears in an unoccupied
space that you can see within range. The
celestial disappears when it drops to 0 hit
points or when the spell
ends.</p>

<p>The celestial is friendly to you and your
companions for the duration. Roll initiative
for the celestial, which has its own turns.
It obeys any verbal commands that you issue
to it (no action required by you), as long as
they don’t violate its alignment. If you
don’t issue any commands to the celestial, it
defends itself from hostile creatures but
otherwise takes no actions.</p>

<p>The DM has the celestial’s statistics.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you
summon a celestial of challenge rating 5 or
lower.</p>
