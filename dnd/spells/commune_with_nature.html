<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 minute</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p>You briefly become one with nature and gain
knowledge of the surrounding territory. In
the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge
of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves
and other natural underground settings, the
radius is limited to 300 feet. The spell
doesnâ€™t function where nature has been
replaced by construction, such as in dungeons
and towns.</p>

<p>You instantly gain knowledge of up to three
facts of your choice about any of the
following subjects as they relate to the
area:</p>

<ul>
    <li>terrain and bodies of water</li>

    <li>prevalent plants, minerals, animals, or
        peoples</li>

    <li>powerful celestials, fey, fiends,
        elementals, or undead</li>

    <li>influence from other planes of existence</li>

    <li>buildings</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, you could determine the location
of powerful undead in the area, the location
of major sources of safe drinking water, and
the location of any nearby towns.</p>
