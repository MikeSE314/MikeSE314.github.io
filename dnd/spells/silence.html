<h1>Silence</h1>

<p><i>2nd-level illusion (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 120 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>For the duration, no sound can be created
within or pass through a 20-foot-radius
sphere centered on a point you choose within
range. Any creature or object entirely inside
the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and
creatures are deafened while entirely inside
it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal
component is impossible there.</p>
