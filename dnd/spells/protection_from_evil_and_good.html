<h1>Protection from Evil and Good</h1>

<p><i>1st-level abjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Touch</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (holy water or
powdered silver and iron, which the spell
consumes)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>Until the spell ends, one willing creature
you touch is protected against certain types
of creatures: aberrations, celestials,
elementals, fey, fiends, and
undead.</p>

<p>The protection grants several benefits.
Creatures of those types have disadvantage on
attack rolls against the target. The target
also canâ€™t be charmed, frightened, or
possessed by them. If the target is already
charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a
creature, the target has advantage on any new
saving throw against the relevant effect.</p>
