<h1>Stinking Cloud</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 90 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a rotten egg or
several skunk cabbage leaves)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow,
nauseating gas centered on a point within
range. The cloud spreads around corners, and
its area is heavily obscured. The cloud
lingers in the air for the
duration.</p>

<p>Each creature that is completely within the
cloud at the start of its turn must make a
Constitution saving throw against poison. On
a failed save, the creature spends its action
that turn retching and reeling. Creatures
that donâ€™t need to breathe or are immune to
poison automatically succeed on this saving
throw.</p>

<p>A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour)
disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong
wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses
it after 1 round.</p>
