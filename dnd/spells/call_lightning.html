<h1>Call Lightning</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level conjuration</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 120 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 10 minutes</p>

<p>A storm cloud appears in the shape of a
cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a 60-foot
radius, centered on a point you can see 100
feet directly above you. The spell fails if
you can’t see a point in the air where the
storm cloud could appear (for example, if you
are in a room that can’t accommodate the
cloud).</p>

<p>When you cast the spell, choose a point you
can see within range. A bolt of lightning
flashes down from the cloud to that point.
Each creature within 5 feet of that point
must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. On each of your turns until
the spell ends, you can use your action to
call down lightning in this way again,
targeting the same point or a different one.</p>

<p>If you are outdoors in stormy conditions when
you cast this spell, the spell gives you
control over the existing storm instead of
creating a new one. Under such conditions,
the spell’s damage increases by 1d10.</p>

<p><i><b>At Higher Levels.</b></i> When you cast this
spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher
level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each
slot level above 3rd.</p>
