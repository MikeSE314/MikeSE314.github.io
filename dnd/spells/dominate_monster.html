<h1>Dominate Monster</h1>

<p><i>8th-level enchantment</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 60 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 hour</p>

<p>You attempt to beguile a creature that you
can see within range. It must succeed on a
Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for
the duration. If you or creatures that are
friendly to you are fighting it, it has
advantage on the saving
throw.</p>

<p>While the creature is charmed, you have a
telepathic link with it as long as the two of
you are on the same plane of existence. You
can use this telepathic link to issue
commands to the creature while you are
conscious (no action required), which it does
its best to obey. You can specify a simple
and general course of action, such as “Attack
that creature,” “Run over there,” or “Fetch
that object.” If the creature completes the
order and doesn’t receive further direction
from you, it defends and preserves itself to
the best of its ability.</p>

<p>You can use your action to take total and
precise control of the target. Until the end
of your next turn, the creature takes only
the actions you choose, and doesn’t do
anything that you don’t allow it to do.
During this time, you can also cause the
creature to use a reaction, but this requires
you to use your own reaction as well.</p>
