<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a small silver
mirror)</p>

<p>You ward a creature within range
against
attack. Until the spell ends, any creature
who targets the warded creature with an
attack or a harmful spell must first make a
Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
creature must choose a new target or lose the
attack or spell. This spell doesnâ€™t protect
the warded creature from area effects, such

fireball.</p>

<p>If the warded creature makes an attack or
casts a spell that affects an enemy creature,
this spell ends.</p>
