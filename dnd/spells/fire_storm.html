<p>A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame
appears in a location you choose within
range. The area of the storm consists of up
to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can arrange
as you wish. Each cube must have at least one
face adjacent to the face of another cube.
Each creature in the area must make a
Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire
damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.</p>

<p>The fire damages objects in the area and
ignites flammable objects that aren't being
worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in
the area is unaffected by this spell.</p>
