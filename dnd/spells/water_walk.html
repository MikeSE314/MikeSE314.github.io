<h1>Water Walk</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level transmutation (ritual)</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> 30 feet</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a piece of cork)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> 1 hour</p>

<p>This spell grants the ability to move across
any liquid surface—such as water, acid, mud,
snow, quicksand, or lava—as if it were
harmless solid ground (creatures crossing
molten lava can still take damage from the
heat). Up to ten willing creatures you can
see within range gain this ability for the
duration.</p>

<p>If you target a creature submerged in a
liquid, the spell carries the target to the
surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet
per round.</p>
