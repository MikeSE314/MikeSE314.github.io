<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 gp)</p>

<p>A sphere of negative energy ripples out in a
60-foot- radius sphere from a point within

Constitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6
necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one.</p>

spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each
slot level above 6th.</p>
