<p><i>Enchantment cantrip</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> S, M (a small amount of makeup applied to the face as this spell is cast)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>For the duration, you have advantage on all
Charisma checks directed at one creature of
your choice that isn’t hostile toward you.
When the spell ends, the creature realizes
that you used magic to influence its mood and
becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone
to violence might attack you. Another
creature might seek retribution in other ways
(at the DM’s discretion), depending on the
nature of your interaction with it.</p>
