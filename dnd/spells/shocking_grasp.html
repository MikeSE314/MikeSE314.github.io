<p>Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a
shock to a creature you try to touch. Make a
melee spell attack against the target. You
have advantage on the attack roll if the
target is wearing armor made of metal. On a
hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage,
and it can’t take reactions until the start
of its next
turn.</p>

<p>The spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you
reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and
17th level (4d8).</p>
