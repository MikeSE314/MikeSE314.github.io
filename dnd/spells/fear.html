<h1>Fear</h1>

<p><i>3rd-level illusion</i></p>

<p><b>Casting Time:</b> 1 action</p>

<p><b>Range:</b> Self (30-foot cone)</p>

<p><b>Components:</b> V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)</p>

<p><b>Duration:</b> Concentration, up to 1 minute</p>

<p>You project a phantasmal image of a
creature’s worst fears. Each creature in a
30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving
throw or drop whatever it is holding and
become frightened for the
duration.</p>

<p>While frightened by this spell, a creature
must take the Dash action and move away from
you by the safest available route on each of
its turns, unless there is nowhere to move.
If the creature ends its turn in a location
where it doesn’t have line of sight to you,
the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw.
On a successful save, the spell ends for that
creature.</p>
