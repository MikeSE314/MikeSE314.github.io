<p><i><b>Shapechanger.</b></i> The weretiger can use its action to polymorph into a tiger-humanoid hybrid or into a tiger, or back into its true form, which is humanoid. Its statistics, other than its size, are the same in each form.</p>
<p>Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
<p><i><b>Keen Hearing and Smell.</b></i> The weretiger has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.</p>
<p><i><b>Pounce (Tiger or Hybrid Form Only).</b></i> If the weretiger moves at least 15 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a claw attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone. If the target is prone, the weretiger can make one bite attack against it as a bonus action.</p>
