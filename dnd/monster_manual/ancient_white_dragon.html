<p><i><b>Ice Walk.</b></i> The dragon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn't cost it extra moment.</p>
<p><i><b>Legendary Resistance (3/Day).</b></i> If the dragon fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
<p><i><b>Multiattack.</b></i> The dragon can use its Frightful Presence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.</p>
<p><i><b>Bite.</b></i> <i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 19 (2d 10 + 8) piercing damage plus 9 (2d8) cold damage.</p>
<p><i><b>Claw.</b></i> <i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 15 (2d6 + 8) slashing damage.</p>
<p><i><b>Tail.</b></i> <i>Melee Weapon Attack:</i> +14 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. <i>Hit:</i> 17 (2d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage.</p>
<p><i><b>Frightful Presence.</b></i> Each creature of the dragon's choice that is within 120 feet of the dragon and aware of it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the dragon's Frightful Presence for the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><i><b>Cold Breath (Recharge 5-6).</b></i> The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 90-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
<h3>Legendary Actions</h3>
<p>The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.</p>
<p><i><b>Detect.</b></i> The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.</p>
<p><i><b>Tail Attack.</b></i> The dragon makes a tail attack.</p>
<p><i><b>Wing Attack (Costs 2 Actions).</b></i> The dragon beats its wings. Each creature within 15 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Dexterity saving throw or take 15 (2d6 + 8) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.</p>
